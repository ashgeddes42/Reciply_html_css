        <p class = 'info'>Reciply is a recipe sharing website. It is my major project for Year 12 Software Design and Development. Please click on the links in the navigation bar to explore.
        <br><br>
        <b>Note:</b> this is a prototype of the Graphical User Interface for the website. The website is not fully functional and many of the links are deadlinks. However, all of the links to different pages in the website (including both the login and create account pages) are working.
        <br><br>
        Also, the website design is not completed, and may evolve as the project continues. Some features of the website appear unfinished (such as the images above) and these will be updated in further stages of development.
